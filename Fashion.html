            The fashion industry is certainly not for the faint of heart.  It is an industry full of ups and down.  And it is one that is quite labor-intensive.  Fashionable apparel begins as the aesthetic brainchild of a designer (or team of designers).  And as the item(s) gain life, each works its way through the many facets of the manufacturing process.  
            Fashion impacting the Youth
            The positive side of fashion is it enhances your life. It not only allows you to dress fashionably but also allows being independent in thinking and maintaining self-esteem. At the same time, fashion is negatively impacting the youth. It has taken up the life of the youth so much that the youngsters are highly obsessed with creating style statements at an age where they need to focus on their studies and other important aspects of life. The fashion trend has become a cult with todayâ€™s generation. They blindly try to imitate the models and celebrities without understanding the true essence of fashion.
